# 🌍 World Population Data Analysis

This project analyzes **global population trends (1970–2022)** using data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The goal is to uncover patterns in population growth, distributions across continents, and highlight countries with significant demographic changes.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** CSV file containing population counts & percentages for countries and continents.  
- **Time range:** 1970 → 2022  
- **Features:** Country, Continent, Year, Population, % of World Population  

---

## 🚀 Features & Insights
- Visualize population growth over time.  
- Compare top populated countries across decades.  
- Analyze continent-level population distribution.  
- Explore percentage share of countries in world population.
